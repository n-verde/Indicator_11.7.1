# SDG Indicator 11.7.1

## General Information
This repository contains the code developed for mapping urban open spaces (UOS) and land allocated to streets (LAS) at the city level, using Planetscope and Sentinel-1 imagery and deep learning, for aiding the calculation of SDG indicator 11.7.1.

*Urban open spaces (UOS) mapped using only Planetscope imagery (a,b) and using both Planetscope and Stneinl-1 (c,d), in densely built-up areas (a,c) and in green suburbs of the Athens metropolitan area (b,d)*
